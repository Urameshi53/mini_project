• Information Overload: In an era of abundant information, finding 
reliable and relevant content can be overwhelming. Information hubs 
curate and organize content, helping users sift through the noise to 
access valuable information.
• Dispersed Knowledge: Valuable knowledge is scattered across the 
internet. Vibez consolidate information from various sources, making it 
easier for users to access diverse content in one place.
• Quality Control: Ensuring the accuracy and credibility of online 
information can be challenging. Vibez employs quality control measures 
such as fact-checking and source verification to provide users with 
trustworthy content.
• Search Complexity: Standard search engines may not always yield 
desired results. Vibez offer specialized search functionalities and wellstructured taxonomies, simplifying the process of finding specific 
information.
• Content Organization: Many students struggle to organize and save 
important information for later reference. Vibez includes features for 
bookmarking, saving and categorizing content.
• Community Collaboration: Students seeking insights and discussions 
on specific topics can benefit from Vibez because it fosters a sense of 
community and collaboration through features like comments, forums 
or user-generated content.
Methodology
The system architecture is designed, focusing on the interaction between 
components. Django's Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is utilized to 
ensure separation of concerns. HTML JavaScript and CSS are used to create 
responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
Jinja is integrated into the templates to enable dynamic content rendering. The 
site will be controlled by a Django administration to prevent fraud and 
unauthorized access.
Technical Requirements
Front-end: HTML, CSS, jinja, JavaScript
Back-end: Django, Python
Database: SQL
Hosting: WSGI server
